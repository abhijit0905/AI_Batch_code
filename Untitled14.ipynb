Your task is to compute and return the distance traveled by the vehicle. Formula: To calculate the distance traveled by a vehicle: Distance=Speed×Time Input: Two floating-point numbers, speed and time, representing the speed of the vehicle and the time it has been traveling. Output: A floating-point number representing the distance traveled.\n",
